        <h3>July 7th - Day 1.</h3>
        <h5>
          My name is Jorge Robles and I am a fledgling Software Engineer learning about web development and programming.
        </h5>
        <p>
         Today is July 7th. It's been a while since my intro post in Feburary. I unfortunately had to take some time off from learning programming and get my life together. I last stopped at the beginnings of JavaScript before getting lost in tutorial hell, facing burn out from my current job, and the existential crisis that was realizing that my current career is not for me. I hated my job, and spent the next few months trying to survive to June 28th - the last day of work. 
         </p>
         <p>
            It is now July, five months after my last post. I have accomplished a lot, and I am very proud of it. I signed up for a second Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and have been relearning mathematics - my biggest fear when I was young - in order to accomplish my goal to become a legitimate programmer. I am currently one week into a four-week course on Precalculus as a prerequisite to the main math sequence at my college and trying my best. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I am now free from my last job and am looking for part-time employment elsewhere in order to pay for my living expenses. My goal is to become a web developer by March 2023. I will study at least 4-5 hours a day to reach this goal alongside part-time school and part-time work. This is a timeline of about 9 months, with about 2 months prior spent actually learning, so it would give me about a 1 year timeline - a reasonable goal.  
         </p>
