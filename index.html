        <h2>Welcome to my blog.</h2>
        <h5 class="me">
          My name is Jorge Robles and I am a professionally licensed K-12 Music
          Teacher in NYS, specializing in instrumental music such as band as well as a Full-Stack Software Engineer.
        </h5>
        <p>
          Today is February 24th, 2022 and I have been learning HTML and CSS for
          about five weeks, with this fifth week being my first foray into
          JavaScript. This is my starting point for this blog. This blog will
          detail the slow, grueling process of learning programming, and
          specifically full-stack web developement from scratch. I have never
          actually coded or programmed before and have spent the past six years
          of my life so far training to become a music teacher before the
          COVID-19 pandemic damaged my profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is mainly for me to express my thoughts about programming,
          transitioning from music, and pretty much whatever is on my mind. If
          you are reading this, that means I have somehow made it into the
          industry and hopefully this blog inspires you to take the leap of
          faith yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current version of this website is written using HTML5 and vanilla
          CSS. No frameworks, just plain and simple CSS. This website will be
          pushed to GitHub where you will hopefully see the website's
          progression into it's final form by the end of my self-taught journey.
